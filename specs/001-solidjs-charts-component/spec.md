# Feature Specification: SolidJS Charts Component

**Feature Branch**: `001-solidjs-charts-component`  
**Created**: September 25, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "solidjs charts component, wraps charts.js so the chart component can be used natively inside solidjs."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: Which Chart.js chart types should the component support? ‚Üí A: All major types (line, bar, pie, doughnut, scatter, bubble, radar)
- Q: How should the component handle responsive behavior and container sizing? ‚Üí A: Automatically resize to fit parent container dimensions
- Q: What level of TypeScript support should the component provide? ‚Üí A: Full TypeScript with strict typing for all props and events
- Q: How should the component handle configuration and customization options? ‚Üí A: Separate props for common options (colors, labels) plus config prop for advanced
- Q: What should happen when Chart.js fails to initialize or encounters rendering errors? ‚Üí A: Display error message in place of chart

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a SolidJS developer, I want to integrate interactive charts into my SolidJS application using a native component interface, so that I can display data visualizations without having to manually manage Chart.js lifecycle and DOM interactions within SolidJS's reactive system.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a SolidJS application, **When** a developer imports and uses the Chart component with data props, **Then** a chart is rendered and displays the provided data correctly
2. **Given** a rendered chart, **When** the underlying data changes through SolidJS reactive updates, **Then** the chart automatically updates to reflect the new data
3. **Given** a chart component, **When** a developer provides configuration options, **Then** the chart renders with the specified styling, type, and behavior settings
4. **Given** a chart component, **When** user interactions occur (hover, click, etc.), **Then** appropriate events are triggered that can be handled by the SolidJS application

### Edge Cases
- What happens when invalid or empty data is provided to the chart component?
- How does the system handle chart resizing when the container dimensions change?
- When Chart.js fails to initialize or encounters rendering errors, the component displays clear error messages in place of the chart

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a SolidJS component that renders charts using Chart.js as the underlying engine
- **FR-002**: Component MUST accept data as props and automatically render charts based on that data
- **FR-003**: Component MUST support all major Chart.js chart types including line, bar, pie, doughnut, scatter, bubble, and radar charts
- **FR-004**: Component MUST reactively update charts when data props change
- **FR-005**: Component MUST handle Chart.js lifecycle management (creation, updates, destruction) automatically
- **FR-006**: Component MUST support customization through separate props for common options (colors, labels, titles) and a config prop for advanced Chart.js configuration
- **FR-007**: Component MUST provide event handling capabilities for user interactions with charts
- **FR-008**: Component MUST properly clean up Chart.js instances when components are unmounted
- **FR-009**: Component MUST automatically resize charts to fit parent container dimensions and respond to container size changes
- **FR-010**: Component MUST provide full TypeScript support with strict typing for all props, events, and configuration options
- **FR-011**: Component MUST display clear error messages in place of the chart when Chart.js fails to initialize or encounters rendering errors

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Chart Component**: A SolidJS component that wraps Chart.js functionality, accepts data and configuration props, manages Chart.js instance lifecycle
- **Chart Data**: Structured data format expected by the component, transformed for Chart.js consumption
- **Chart Configuration**: Settings object controlling chart appearance, behavior, and interaction options
- **Chart Events**: User interaction events (clicks, hovers) that can be captured and handled by the parent SolidJS application
