# Tasks: SolidJS Charts Component

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-solidjs-charts-component/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✓), research.md (✓), data-model.md (✓), contracts/ (✓), quickstart.md (✓)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root (per plan.md structure decision)

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [x] T001 Create project structure with src/ and tests/ directories
- [x] T002 Initialize TypeScript project with SolidJS, Chart.js, and Vitest dependencies
- [x] T003 [P] Configure ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript compiler options
- [x] T004 [P] Setup Vitest configuration for SolidJS testing

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [x] T005 [P] Component API contract test in tests/contract/chart-component.test.ts
- [x] T006 [P] Basic chart rendering integration test in tests/integration/basic-rendering.test.ts  
- [x] T007 [P] Reactive data updates integration test in tests/integration/reactive-updates.test.ts
- [x] T008 [P] Chart type switching integration test in tests/integration/chart-types.test.ts
- [x] T009 [P] Event handling integration test in tests/integration/event-handling.test.ts
- [x] T010 [P] Error handling integration test in tests/integration/error-handling.test.ts
- [x] T011 [P] Responsive behavior integration test in tests/integration/responsive.test.ts

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [ ] T012 [P] TypeScript type definitions in src/types/chart-types.ts
- [ ] T013 [P] Chart data validation utilities in src/utils/validation.ts
- [ ] T014 Main Chart component in src/components/Chart.tsx
- [ ] T015 Chart.js lifecycle management hooks in src/hooks/useChart.ts
- [ ] T016 Error boundary component in src/components/ChartErrorBoundary.tsx
- [ ] T017 Component export barrel file in src/index.ts

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [ ] T018 Integrate reactive data updates with Chart.js update() method
- [ ] T019 Implement responsive resize handling with ResizeObserver
- [ ] T020 Add Chart.js event delegation for click and hover events
- [ ] T021 Implement proper cleanup in component unmount lifecycle

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [ ] T022 [P] Unit tests for validation utilities in tests/unit/validation.test.ts
- [ ] T023 [P] Unit tests for type definitions in tests/unit/types.test.ts
- [ ] T024 [P] Performance tests for large datasets in tests/performance/large-data.test.ts
- [ ] T025 [P] Update README.md with installation and usage examples
- [ ] T026 [P] Create TypeScript declaration files for npm publishing
- [ ] T027 Bundle size optimization and tree-shaking verification
- [ ] T028 Manual testing with quickstart.md examples

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T004) before tests (T005-T011)
- Tests (T005-T011) before implementation (T012-T021)
- T012 (types) blocks T013, T014, T015, T016
- T014 (main component) blocks T018, T019, T020, T021
- Implementation (T012-T021) before polish (T022-T028)

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T005-T011 together (all different test files):
Task: "Component API contract test in tests/contract/chart-component.test.ts"
Task: "Basic chart rendering integration test in tests/integration/basic-rendering.test.ts"
Task: "Reactive data updates integration test in tests/integration/reactive-updates.test.ts"
Task: "Chart type switching integration test in tests/integration/chart-types.test.ts"
Task: "Event handling integration test in tests/integration/event-handling.test.ts"
Task: "Error handling integration test in tests/integration/error-handling.test.ts"
Task: "Responsive behavior integration test in tests/integration/responsive.test.ts"

# Launch T012, T013, T016 together (different files, no dependencies):
Task: "TypeScript type definitions in src/types/chart-types.ts"
Task: "Chart data validation utilities in src/utils/validation.ts"
Task: "Error boundary component in src/components/ChartErrorBoundary.tsx"
```

## Task Details

### Critical Test Requirements
- **T005**: Test component props interface, TypeScript typing, and basic instantiation
- **T006**: Test chart renders in DOM with correct Chart.js instance
- **T007**: Test chart updates when SolidJS signals change
- **T008**: Test all 7 chart types (line, bar, pie, doughnut, scatter, bubble, radar)
- **T009**: Test onChartClick and onChartHover event handlers
- **T010**: Test error display when Chart.js fails to initialize
- **T011**: Test automatic resize when container dimensions change

### Implementation Priorities
- **T014**: Core Chart component with SolidJS reactivity integration
- **T015**: Chart.js lifecycle management (onMount, onCleanup, createEffect)
- **T018**: Reactive data updates using Chart.js update() method
- **T019**: ResizeObserver integration for responsive behavior

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Focus on simple approach per requirements
- Use Chart.js defaults where possible
- Maintain SolidJS reactivity patterns
- Ensure TypeScript strict mode compliance

## Validation Checklist
- ✅ Component API contract has test (T005)
- ✅ All user scenarios have integration tests (T006-T011)
- ✅ All entities from data-model.md covered (Chart Component, Chart Data, etc.)
- ✅ TypeScript definitions for all interfaces (T012)
- ✅ Error handling implementation (T016, T010)
- ✅ Performance considerations (T024, T027)
- ✅ Documentation and examples (T025, T028)
